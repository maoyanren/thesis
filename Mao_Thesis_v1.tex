\abstract		% Abstract.
Nanopores have very important applications in molecule\//polymer detection and separation. The flow field in the vicinity of a nanopore is crucial to the motion of the translocating molecule\//polymer. This dissertation addresses the problem of electroosmotic pumping of fluid through a nanopore that traverses a charged, dielectric membrane. 

The strength and structure of the flow depends on several parameters including the geometry of the nanopore, external voltage, concentration of the electrolyte solution and the properties of the membrane material, such as polarity and surface charge density. Under weak field assumption, perturbation method can be utilized for theoretical modeling of flow field in the linear regime. When the membrane thickness is zero, the reciprocal theorem gives the flow rate generated by an applied voltage in the form of an integral over the fluid domain. For a circular hole in a membrane of zero thickness, the integral can be worked out in closed form and computed up to quadrature. When the membrane thickness is non--zero, the flow rate under applied field can be obtained by patching the zero--thickness solution with the analytical solution of electroosmotic flow in a cylindrical channel. The effect of the electric double layer thickness is also considered and theory is modified when it is not negligible compared to the membrane thickness. When the intrinsic surface charges on the membrane are neutralized, eddies with length scale of a few nanometers could arise within the pore due to induced charge electroosmosis. The flow strength in this case is found to be proportional to square of the applied voltage. The shape of the eddies is found to be dependent on the geometry of the pore.

Numerical solvers to solve the full governing system of equations are developed based on finite volume method. The solvers are able to compute the coupled electrostatics, ionic transport and Stokes flow equations. Numerical results agree with theoretical models in the corresponding parameter regimes. A finite element software package is also utilized to capture the multi--physics processes. The simulation tools are applied to study electroosmotic nanojet from a nanocapillary, and the results are compared with the experimental work at our collaborator\'{}s group.
